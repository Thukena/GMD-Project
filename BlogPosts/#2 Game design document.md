# Blog post 2 - Game design document

## Game name: Speedy Samu

##  The idea of the game
I plan to design a 2d platformer, where you will play as a character that can move, jump, dash, attack and maybe more. The player should then be able to get stronger during gameplay by defeating enemies and completing levels. The game should incentivize the player to beat the levels quickly since the enemies will get stronger the more as time goes on.

## The game's Aesthetics

### Mastery
The game should aim to motivate the players to master the game. It is important the game has fun and interesting mechanics, where the players want to master each unique mechanic. So, for example, the game could make the player want to improve their movement and learn enemies attack patterns.


### Challenge
The game should aim to be challenging by making fun, but difficult obstacles to overcome, that feel rewarding when completed. It should also motivate the player to try to survive as long as possible or beat the levels as fast as possible, by making it a challenge to do so.

### Sensation
#### Satisfying
The game should aim to be satisfying when moving, attacking and killing enemies. This could be done with satisfying animations and sounds when the player performs an action.
#### empowerment
It should also aim to make the player feel empowerment by getting stronger during gameplay, going from weak to strong.

##  Development milestones

### Milestone 1 - Fun playable character
First try to make the movement of the character and try to make it fun just to travel around the world.

### Milestone 2 - Challenges
Create enemies and obstacles the player can interact with. At least one level should be beatable at this milestone.

### Milestone 3 - Powerups
Create interesting and fun powerups to increase the power of the player as the enemies get stronger.
